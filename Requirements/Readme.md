## Features
- The System will sense is driver or passenger is seated or not.
- Driver or Passenger has the access to change the temperature in the vehicle.
- As per Driver's request, Heater will generate the heat accordingly.
- It is mainly useful for the European Countries.
- cost of the project is low and it's a robust system.
- Modular Approach is required.

## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats
### Strengths
- User Friendly
- Easy to alter the temperature inside the vehicle.
- Low cost and Robust system.

### Weakness
- Its only applicable for the countries having low temperature.
### Opportunities
- It can be implemented by having both Heater and AC.
### Threats
- Not suitable for average or high temperature places.
